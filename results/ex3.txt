        "ESG fund managers said their focus on nontraditional risks led to portfolios of companies that so far have been resilient during the COVID-19 downturn.",
        "\"For us, sustainability is not an end in and of itself; it is a means by which we turn over more rocks, look at more information, and add a complementary lens in order to gain conviction on a company's strategy, operations, and prospects for growth,\" said Karina Funk, a portfolio manager at Brown Advisory Inc. and the firm's head of sustainable investing, in an emailed statement.",
        "The Brown Advisory Sustainable Growth Fund, which had equity assets valued at about $1.8 billion as of April 9 according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, holds positions in 34 companies including Microsoft Corp., American Tower Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.

        "Both Streur and Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management Inc., said their funds are losing fewer investors than the broader market in part because ESG-focused investors tend to take a longer-term view.",
        "\"Our loss is on the market, it's not on redemptions,\" Samuelrich said in an interview.",
        "\"I do think values-based investors are stickier, and so if people didn't want to invest in fracking two months ago, they still don't.\"",

        "\"I tend to steer away from placing too much weight on such short time periods, and whilst it's tempting to draw positive conclusions it is worth reining that in somewhat [and] recognizing that sustainable investment is a long-term thesis and these are extraordinary times with various factors at play,\" Gillett said in an email on April 7.",
        "The unfolding economic downturn is also forcing some ESG investors to reconsider their corporate engagement strategies as many companies struggle just to stay afloat or maneuver to refit their factories to produce needed medical supplies.",
